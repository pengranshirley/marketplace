* For simplicity, currently, click login will divert to Google's own login page. First time user wil be diverted to sign up page.
  I saw you try to let users have their own password, but right now I don't think we have enough time to handle the security issue behind.
  So right now, I am still using google's own account as login mechanism.

* What needs to be implemented next?
Display products by category
User profile page ( For all user or for current user? current user will be simpler)
Mark an item as sold
=======above are compulsory? ======
